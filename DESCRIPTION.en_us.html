<p>Castoro is a specific instance of an adaptive design developed for Tiro Typeworks’ internal use as a base from which to generate tailored Latin companions for some of our non-European script types.</p>
     
<p>The instance that has been expanded to create the Castoro fonts began as a synthesis of aspects of assorted Dutch types from the 16–18th Centuries and was initially made for the Indic fonts that we produced for Harvard University Press. In the Castoro version, we have retained the extensive diacritic set for transliteration of South Asian languages and added additional characters for an increased number of European languages.</p>

<p>Castoro is named for the North American beaver, Castor canadensis. Robust serif text types with extensive language and typographic layout support are sometimes referred to as ‘workhorse’ types. Castoro may be thought of as a busy beaver.</p>
