# Castoro sources

The glyph design sources are in FontLab 7 .vfj format. These sources also contain the classes and kerning data used in the OpenType Layout GPOS table, and the GSUB code in .fea format.

The OpenType Layout for the Castoro fonts was initially developed in Microsoftâ€˜s Visual OpenType Layout Tool .vtp format, then converted to .fea syntax using our [Volto](https://github.com/TiroTypeworks/Volto) conversion tool, and integrated into the FontLab 7 .vfj sources. As of version 1.10 (build 002), the .vfj files should be considered the source for OTL, and the previously available .vtp files have been removed from the repo.
